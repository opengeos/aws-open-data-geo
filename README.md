# aws-open-data-geo

A list of open geospatial datasets on AWS. The [AWS Open Data Program](https://registry.opendata.aws/) hosts a lot of geospatial datasets. This repo compiles a list of all geo datasets on AWS as a CSV file and as a JSON file, making it easier to find and use them. The list is updated daily.

A complete list of AWS Open Data Program datasets is available [here](https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry).
