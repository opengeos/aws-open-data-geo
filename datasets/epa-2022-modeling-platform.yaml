  OAQPS 2022 Modeling Platform 
Description: >-
  The data are part of the 2022 Modeling Platform used to support regulatory actions
  and technical analyses conducted by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and
  Standards. Specifically, this data includes Weather Research and Forecasting Model (v4.4.2)
  conducted at a 12-km resolution over the Continental United States (12US). MCIP-processed
  files and wrfcamx-processed (12US1 domain) are also available as part of this dataset 
  to assist in the use of emissions processing and photochemical modeling. These files 
  may be used in downstream applications to generate emissions, photochemical 
  modeling, or dispersion modeling inputs. Additionally, lateral boundary condition files 
  generated using GEOS-CF at 36-km with results translated from GEOS-Chem species available 
  in GEOS-CF to CMAQ cb6/ae7. Simulations for boundary conditions covering the northern 
  hemisphere are also provided. These simulations were conducted using CMAQ v5.4 and GEOS-Chem
  v14.0.1. The 2022v1 emissions are provided for a 36km grid over North America (36US3) and two 
  12km grids (12SU1 and 12US2). See the documentation for pictures of the grids. The types 
  of emissions data provided include point sources, nonpoint sources, mobiles sources, 
  fires, lightning NOx, and biogenic emissions. Input files for computing biogenic emissions
  inline within CMAQ are also provided. README text files are included at multiple levels 
  within the directory structure to explain files at that level. For more information about 
  the emissions, see the below documentation or the 2022v1 web page:

  - Description: >-
      The 2022 WRF output are stored as uncompressed netcdf/hdf5 formatted files in 
      the /WRF directory. The 2022 MCIP output are stored as uncompressed netcdf/hdf5 
      formatted files in IOAPI format in the /MCIP directory. The wrfcamx files are stored 
      as uncompressed netcdf files in the /wrfcamx directory. Information on the model 
      projection and grid structure is contained in the header information of the 
      netcdf file. The netcdf files can be opened and manipulated using software programs 
      that can read and write netcdf formatted files (e.g. Fortran, R, Python).
      The WRF files are daily files containing hourly data beginning at 00UTC through
      23UTC for each modeled day. For more information: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/
      The MCIP files are daily files with multiple files for each day. For more information
      about what each MCIP file contains, please see the following GitHub entry:
      https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/blob/main/PREP/mcip/README.md For more information about
      what each wrfcamx file contains, please see the README file in the wrfcamx source

      The 2022v1 emissions data are stored as uncompressed netcdf files in the /emis directory. 
      The year 2022 CMAQ-ready emissions are provided under the folder 2022hc_cb6_22m
