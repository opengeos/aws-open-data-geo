Name: Demand-Side Grid (dsgrid) Toolkit 
Description: |
  Projects that use the dsgrid toolkit assemble bottom-up descriptions of electricity 
  demand and related data that are highly resolved geographically, temporally, and sectorally. 
  Typically modelers describe multiple scenarios of future energy use at hourly resolution, 
  suitable for inclusion in long-term power system planning models, i.e., capacity expansion and 
  production cost models.
